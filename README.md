# About:

This Brand Ambassador mobile application was created through my personal experience as a brand ambassador working for multiple companies and through those experiences came different problems I ran into. This application was to resolve many of the problems and quality of life improvments that I wanted to have while working and seeking jobs as a brand ambassador.

#### Problem
While applying for brand ambassador jobs were mainly through Facebook groups I noticed that it was easy for an employer to post a job, however, it was quite difficult for them to find the right person for the job. As these jobs are technically categorized for the gig economy (1-3 shifts with 4-8h long shifts each on average), getting people for the job was always difficult and sometimes resulted in the job even being cancelled by the employer. On the other hand, as a job seeker, I found it very easy to miss job opportunities and when I did apply, I had to wait for slow and sometimes late responses, send out my resume multiple times, and wait for background checks which resulted in a lot of time wasted especially for a quick job.

### Solution
Create a simple and easy to use application for both Employers and Employees to offer and apply for jobs. My goal and inspiration in terms of design were taken from similar gig economy mobile applications such as Uber and SkiptheDishes. As seen below, I attempted to create a minimalist yet simple to use application. Applying for jobs was a simple one button tap which allowed you to send out your resume and any other requirements directly to the employer to approve. On the employer side, visualizing applicants and approving them was also made with a single button. In terms of background checks, I found that having gviing the employer and employee the right to review each other would resolve that issue (Although not a perfect resolution).

* I have also included a video demonstration of the application below

** As this was my first mobile application and first experience with node.js, react.js, CSS and even JavaScript, some of the goals set out are still a work in progress.
